# DA14585/DA14586 Active scanner

---


## Example description

The device is setup in active scanning mode. On advertising data report, the
data is formatted and pushed on the UART. The user can read the peripheral
advertising data in a friendly way on its serial terminal.

## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585/DA14586 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- A Basic or Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Studio 1.6.3.
    * SDK6.0.10
